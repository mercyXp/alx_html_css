# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page

This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a responsive landing page design, built entirely **from scratch** using **HTML and CSS** — with no external libraries, frameworks, or JavaScript (except where explicitly required in the final task).

## 🧠 Project Overview

This webpage replicates a Figma design created by UI/UX designer **Nicolas Philippot**. It demonstrates mastery of modern web development foundations including:

- HTML5 semantic structure
- CSS3 styling, layout, and animations
- Responsive design using media queries
- Accessibility and usability principles
- Mobile-first design philosophy

## 📁 Directory

All project files are located in:  
**`alx_html_css/headphones/`**

## 🧩 Sections Built

Each section of the page is completed as a separate task:

1. **Header/Hero** — Responsive top navigation and call-to-action section.
2. **What We Do** — Service overview with custom font icons.
3. **Our Results** — Visual data metrics with dynamic layout.
4. **Contact Form** — Clean and functional contact form (with optional field validation).
5. **Footer** — Consistent and clean final touch for the page.
6. **CSS Shapes** — Replacing image with pure CSS pentagons.
7. **Animations** — Enhancing interactivity with transitions and effects.
8. **Hamburger Menu** — Responsive navigation toggle for small screens (JavaScript-enabled).

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Mobile version activates at screen widths ≤ 480px

  - Button hover: `opacity: 0.9`
